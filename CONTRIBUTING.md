request to merge your changes back into master. Before you create a pull request, ensure that:

- you have created unit tests (using [testthat](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html))
- github actions builds successfully on your new branch
- the changes that you are making are not partial but are a finished piece of work
- changes have been signed off by managers or discussed with the team
